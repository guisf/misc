ABOUT
-----

This program is used to split domain names into its composing words.

The program consists of a simple graphical interface, that takes one
input 'txt' file and an output 'csv' file. The program find all domain names
inside the input file, and write to the output file the domains with its
separated composing words. Only domains consisting of 2 or 3 words are
left, and it should contain no number or hyphens in it.

It uses the viterbi algorithm to compute probabilities of words.
